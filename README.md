# Memory Grid

A kickass memory game brought to you by Ethan Dickinson and the good folks at Solum.

### Project Description:

The game starts by presenting a grid (N by M grid) with a subset of the elements highlighted to the end user.

After a brief time, the grid will be flipped over, with all the elements reset and no longer highlighted.

The user is then asked to click the positions of the cells in the grid that were highlighted, within a set period of time. 

If the user selects the correct cells, he or she will be taken on to the next stage of the game where a more challenging level is presented, by either increasing the number of the highlighted cells (fixed grid size) or by increasing the grid size, or both. The position of the highlighted cells should change with each new game level.

If the user does not guess correctly, we will reset the cells but stay at the same level of difficulty. 

Game play will continue until the user cannot complete a level, or has reached the end of the available options.
